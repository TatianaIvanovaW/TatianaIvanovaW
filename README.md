### A Junior Full Stack Developer based in Amsterdam

I am self-starter with multiple years of experience in various countries and industries.Â 
A year ago my life took a turn since I started to learn coding.
Iâ€™m currently studying in Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam, 
where I've been following an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp for the past three months.

In my last project [Tracker](https://github.com/TatianaIvanovaW/TravelTracker-client) I've been working with such technologies as React, Redux and GraphQl

Here is [live](https://travel-tips.netlify.app/) and [repo](https://github.com/GuidoWestra/Travel-Tips-Front) of Travel Tips project I developed in coloboration with my classmates.
