## Hi! I am Tatiana ðŸ‘‹
### A Junior Full Stack Developer based in Amsterdam

I am self-starter with multiple years of experience in various countries and industries.Â 
A year ago my life took a turn since I started to learn coding.
Iâ€™m currently studying in Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam, 
where I've been following an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp for the past three months.

In my last project [Tracker](https://github.com/TatianaIvanovaW/TravelTracker-client) I've been working with such technologies as React, Redux and GraphQl

[Travel.Tips](https://github.com/GuidoWestra/Travel-Tips-Front) app I developed in collaboration with [Guido Westra](https://github.com/GuidoWestra) and [Fabiana Colombo](https://github.com/fabianaColombo)
