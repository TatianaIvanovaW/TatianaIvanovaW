## Hi! I am Tatiana ðŸ‘‹
### A Junior Full Stack Developer from Amsterdam

I am self-starter with multiple years of experience in various countries and industries.Â 
A year ago my life took a turn since I started to learn coding.
Iâ€™m currently studying in Codaisseur Academy in Amsterdam, 
where I've been following an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp for the past three months.

In my [last project](https://traveltracker.netlify.app/) I've been working with such technologies as Reacr, REdux and GraphQl
